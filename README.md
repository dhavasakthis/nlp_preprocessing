Natural Language processing - preprocessing steps


In Natural Language Processing (NLP), preprocessing is a crucial step that involves transforming raw text data into a format that can be efficiently and effectively used by machine learning models. Here are the key steps involved in NLP preprocessing:

1. Text Cleaning
Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Removing Punctuation: Remove or handle punctuation marks.
Removing Special Characters: Remove characters like #, @, &, etc.
Removing Numbers: Depending on the context, numbers might be removed.
2. Tokenization
Word Tokenization: Split the text into individual words.
Sentence Tokenization: Split the text into sentences.
Subword Tokenization: Break down words into subwords, especially useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words.
3. Stop Word Removal
Stop Words: Remove common words like "and," "the," "is," etc., that do not contribute significantly to the meaning of the text.
4. Stemming and Lemmatization
Stemming: Reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" to "run").
Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "better" to "good").
